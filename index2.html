      <h2>About Al-Farabi</h2>
      <p>
        Al-Farabi (872–950), also known as Alpharabius, was a renowned philosopher, scientist, and scholar 
        of the Islamic Golden Age. Born in Farab (modern Kazakhstan), he contributed greatly to philosophy, logic, 
        music, and political theory. Often called the "Second Teacher" after Aristotle, his works influenced 
        both Islamic and European thought.
